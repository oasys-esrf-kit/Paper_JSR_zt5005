Repository for the generation of the training datasets. In Noll notation, the polynomials  Z5-Z14; Z22 and Z37 will be investigated at first

typical values representing 2D Be lenses with R = 50um and L = 1mm:
 - Z11 (spherical aberration 1st order): (1-Gaussian) distribution with sigma = 1um and limited to +- 1.5um;
 - Z22 (spherical aberration 2nd order) and Z37 (spherical aberration 3rd order): (1-Gaussian) distribution with sigma = 0.5um and limited to +- 0.75um;
 - all other coefficients: uniform distribution from -0.75um to +0.75um 
 
 The codes will produce 33 images along the optical axis for several configurations;
 
 The first study case will be a single 2D Be lens with R = 50um and A=440um illuminated at 7 keV (f=3.598m) with a fully-coherent wavefront (later emittance effects can be added to the simulations by blowing up the electron beam emittance)
