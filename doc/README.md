# awesome-mlcrl
ðŸ˜Ž Awesome lists about all kinds of topics and tools interesting to MLCRL funs.

**What is an awesome list?**

Only put stuff on the list that you or another MLCRL participant can personally recommend. You should rather leave stuff out than include too much. Read the [Awesome Manifesto](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md) to find out more what this list is about.

Or if you'd like to check out stuff that is awesome to people outside of MLCRL, then start here: [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

## Learning ML
* [Basic level](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview)
* [Intro course ](https://courses.dataschool.io/introduction-to-machine-learning-with-scikit-learn)
* [Berkeley DLAB course on Deep Learning](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Deep-Learning-in-R) - It is for R, not for Python, but includes material and [slides](https://dlab-berkeley.github.io/Deep-Learning-in-R/slides.html#1)  of interest. In particular it uses Keras. 
* [Berkeley DLAB course on ML in python](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-machine-learning) - Also with [slides](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-machine-learning/blob/master/Machine_Learning_Review.pdf).
* [Berkeley DLAB Artificial Neural Networks fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/ANN-fundamentals)
* [Keras for researches - intro](https://keras.io/getting_started/intro_to_keras_for_researchers/)

## Bibliography - Papers
* [Practical sensorless aberration estimation for 3D microscopy with deep learning](https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.401933)
* [Applying machine learning methods for characterization of hexagonal
prisms from their 2D scattering patterns â€“ an investigation using
modelled scattering data](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jqsrt.2017.07.001)


## Bibliography - Books
* Intro to Statistical Learning** by James et al. [(free pdf)](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20First%20Printing.pdf) [(Amazon)](https://smile.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics-ebook/dp/B01IBM7790/)
* Python Data Science Handbook** by Jake VanderPlas [(online version)](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) - Includes a chapter in ML with Scikit-Learn.
* Elements of Statistical Learning** by Hastie et al.  [(free pdf)](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/download.html) [(Amazon)](https://smile.amazon.com/Elements-Statistical-Learning-Prediction-Statistics-ebook/dp/B00475AS2E/)
